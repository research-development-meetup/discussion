## The Distributed Web

> IPFS is a distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. IPFS is a compilation of great ideas in the academia that are distilled and mixed together, creating a system that is currently being deployed in the network. This talk will cover the network data structures and some cryptography fundamentals of how IPFS works and is made possible.
